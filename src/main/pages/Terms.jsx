                1. Your Eval360 software subscription will continue until
                terminated. To use the Eval360 service you/your company must
                have Internet access and a ready device, and provide us with one
                or more Payment Methods. “Payment Method” means a current,
                valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time
                to time, and which may include payment through your account with
                a third party. Unless you cancel your membership before your
                billing date, you authorize us to charge the membership fee for
                the next billing cycle to your Payment Method (see
                "Cancellation" below). 2. We may offer several subscription
                plans, including subscriptions offered by third parties in
                conjunction with the provision of their products and services.
                We are not responsible for the products and services provided by
                such third parties. Some subscription plans may have differing
                conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at your
                sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You
                can find specific details regarding your Eval360 subscription by
                visiting the Eval360.com website and clicking on the "Account"
                link available at the top of the pages under your profile name.

                1. Billing Cycle. <br />
                The Subscription fee for the Eval360 service and any other
                charges you may incur in connection with your use of the
                service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be
                charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date
                indicated on the "Account" page. The length of your billing
                cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose
                when you signed up for the service. In some cases, your payment
                date may change, for example, if your Payment Method has not
                successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or
                if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given
                month. Visit the Eval360.com website and click on the "Billing
                details" link on the "Account" page to see your next payment
                date. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of
                membership or service-related charges through various methods,
                including authorizing it for up to approximately one month of
                service as soon as you register. If you signed up for
                Enineering360 using your account with a third party as a Payment
                Method, you can find the billing information about your Eval360
                subscription by visiting your account with the applicable third
                party. <br />
                <br />
                2. Payment Methods. <br />
                To use the Eval360 service you must provide one or more Payment
                Methods. You authorize us to charge any Payment Method
                associated with your account in case your primary Payment Method
                is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your
                subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected
                amounts. If payment is not successfully settled, due to
                expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not
                cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service
                until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For
                some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees,
                such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the
                processing of your Payment Method. Local tax charges may vary
                depending on the Payment Method used. Check with your Payment
                Method service provider for details. <br />
                <br />
                3. Updating your Payment Methods. You can update your Payment
                Methods by going to the "Account" page. We may also update your
                Payment Methods using the information provided by the payment
                service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to
                continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s). <br />
                <br />
                4. Cancellation. <br />
                You can cancel your Eval360 subscription at any time, and you
                will continue to have access to the Eval360 service through the
                end of your billing period. To the extent permitted by the
                applicable law, payments are non-refundable and we do not
                provide refunds or credits for any partial membership periods or
                unused Eval360 content. To cancel, go to the "Account" page and
                follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your
                membership, your account will automatically close at the end of
                your current billing period. To see when your account will
                close, click "Billing details" on the "Account" page. If you
                signed up for Eval360 using your account with a third party as a
                Payment Method and wish to cancel your Eval360 subscription, you
                may need to do so through such a third party, for example by
                visiting your account with the applicable third party and
                turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the Eval360
                service through that third party. <br />
                <br />
                4.5. Changes to the Price and Subscription Plans. <br />
                We may change our subscription plans and the price of our
                service from time to time; however, any price changes or changes
                to your subscription plans will apply no earlier than 30 days
                following notice to you.

                fraudulent activity.
